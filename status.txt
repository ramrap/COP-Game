1) Decided to Use DFS in Map so All house will be present at end of maze instead of corners
2) Once House is stolen it will be marked Red.
3) Genrating Random Maze as of now but have to change seed value in CODE . (Tried to send seed value through socket when new client joins but failed to implement before deadline).
4) Small Animations While player was moving.
